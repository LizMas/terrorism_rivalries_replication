# Replication of Findley, Piazza, and Young (2012): Revisiting Terrorism in International Rivalries

#### Description

This is a paper replication I conducted as the final project for GOV 1006 at Harvard Univerisity. 

#### Abstract

Findley, Piazza, and Young (2012) show that interstate rivalries are a positive predictor of transnational terrorist activity. The authors argue that terrorism is often a component of broader hostilities that can be emperically analyzed using a series of politicaly relevant directed dyads. In this paper, I successfully replicated all of their results and executed an extension which used dyadic quasipossion models. These models are equally statistically significant with respect to rivalry, the main concern of the original paper, and thereby confirm that the original findings are robust. However, concerns exist regarding the use of dyadic analysis and the conclusions we can draw from such analysis in general.
